# hello-world
Hello, I have been around computers since a kid. Started with dailup AOL and kid chatrooms. I took A+,and CISCO courses in highschool and continued a little more in college with Intro to Java Programming class. I built all my computers and help my family with pc problems. I love the way computers are organized and look forward to Artifical Intelligence. I am a big fan of the movie HER. I believe in the future, most operating systems will grow up with the user. My hopes are one day to work for microsoft. I am a big fan, and still have a windows phone in use when I want to feed my nostaligia.
